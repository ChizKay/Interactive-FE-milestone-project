                <img src="">
                <P>Kilkenny is a medieval town in southeast Ireland. Its grand Kilkenny Castle was built in 1195 by Norman occupiers. The town has deep religious roots and many well-preserved churches and monasteries, including imposing St. Canice’s Cathedral
                    and the Black Abbey Dominican priory, both from the 13th century. It's also a crafts hub, with shops along its winding lanes selling pottery, paintings and jewellery.</P>

                <P>Galway, a harbour city on Ireland’s west coast, sits where the River Corrib meets the Atlantic Ocean. The city’s hub is 18th-century Eyre Square, a popular meeting spot surrounded by shops and traditional pubs that often
                offer live Irish folk music. Nearby, stone-clad cafes, boutiques and art galleries line the winding lanes of the Latin Quarter, which retains portions of the medieval city walls.</P>

                once a private estate, encompasses forests, lakes and bogland in the Derryveagh Mountains. Its 1870s manor house, the Scottish Baronial-style Glenveagh Castle, is known for its Victorian gardens.</P>
                <h2>5. Dublin</h2>
